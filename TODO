Welcome!

Here are my plans on what I hope to add to this ML model.

-

Manually add:

# Stock market data from last 3 months.

# Demand data of company's product from last 3 months.
->    How relevant is the product the company's selling?

# Social media/public opinions on company's future from last 3 months.
->    Gathered from company's tag on platforms like twitter.
->    Sentiment analysis.
    
# Company's relevancy data from last 3 months.
->    How often are people looking for information on your company?
   
# General public approval ratings.
->    Look into CEO approval, employee approval and general co. approval.
    
# Source general stock information from Robinhood.
->    Collect analyst rating percentages of buy/sell.

-

Automation should take into account:

# New developments in public opinion.
->    Sentiment analysis.

# New developments in approval ratings.
->    CEO, indeed employee ratings/treatment, co. in general.

# Developing stock market shifts.
