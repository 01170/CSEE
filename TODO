Welcome!
Here are my plans on what I hope to add to this ML model.

-

Collect stock data from last 30 days

Collect demand data of company's product from last 30 days
    How relevant is the product the company's selling?

Collect social opinions on company's future from last 30 days
    Gathered from company's tag on platforms like twitter
    Sentiment analysis
    
Collect company's relevancy data from last 30 days
    How often are people looking for information on your company?
   
Collect public approval ratings
    Look into CEO approval, employee approval and general co. approval
    
Create a means by which the model would source data from Robinhood
    Collect analyst rating percentages of buy/sell
