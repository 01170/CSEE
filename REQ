General requirements for an IB EE in Computer Science

-

"A CS EE is meant to be an in-depth study about an aspect of computing. 
It does not have to be limited to what's in the IB syllabus 
(anyway if I'm being honest, the IB syllabus is very shallow when it comes to CS).
Since CS is a G4 subject, you will be required to do some sort of investigation or experiment.
You will be expected to analyze your  finding and come to some sort of conclusion.
Be careful not to focus too much on social/ethical implications or it may become an ITGS EE,
and don't go too deep into mathematical stuff or it may become a math EE."

-

"Your EE does not need to be an experiment. 
CS EEs are a bit of an exception in the science group; 
you are able to do what is essentially a literature review / research paper on a specific topic.
For example if you're evaluating the effectiveness of a certain type of algorithm, 
you could gather data on that yourself but it's entirely valid to do a theoretical analysis of the algorithms, 
estimating why you may want to use one over the other for given reasons."

-

"It is also important that the work goes beyond a summary of journalistic views on a particular topic. It
is not sufficient for the student simply to describe new advances and developments in computing.
Students are expected to analyse their findings and consider the implications."

-

"An in-depth analysis of trends and advances in computing should include aspects
of the theory of computer science, which would necessarily demonstrate a high degree of technical
knowledge and understanding."

-

"Data for analysis may be generated from a program written by the student. This is often an appropriate
method of investigation but the code itself, and its development, will not be rewarded under the
assessment criteria."

-

"The topic chosen should allow the student to make a full appropriate analysis, putting forward his or
her own point of view. Historical aspects of computing do not lend themselves to this treatment.
However, there may sometimes be a place for summarizing developments that have occurred until
now, to put the topic in perspective or to use as a basis for predicting the future."

-

"Although program fragments may be included in the body of the extended
essay to support the design and the discussion, the full program code (including internal
documentation) should appear in an appendix as evidence."

-

"Each line of code that appears in the body of
the essay should count as two words when calculating the length of the essay, while any internal
documentation of a program fragment should be ignored."

-

# Criterion A: research question
Although the aim of the essay can best be defined in the form of a question, it may also be presented as
a statement or proposition for discussion. It must be:
• specific and sharply focused
• appropriate to the particular area of computer science being explored
• centred on computer science and not on peripheral issues such as the history of computing or the social implications of technology
• stated clearly early on in the essay.

-

# Criterion B: introduction
The introduction should relate the research question to existing subject knowledge, putting it into
context. Basic computing knowledge can be assumed and it is not expected that students write lengthy
sections explaining theory that is common knowledge or part of the syllabus of the computer science
course.

-

# Criterion C: investigation
The range and type of sources available will be influenced by various factors, but above all by the topic
chosen. For example, if runs of a program are carried out to test an algorithm for efficiency against an
alternative one then the data must be adequate.
Any statistics collected should be reliable and relevant to the research question. It is also important to
consult a large number of sources. Particular care should be taken in such a rapidly changing area to
ensure that all sources (books, magazines and internet sites) used are up to date.

-

# Criterion D: knowledge and understanding of the topic studied
The student is expected to be capable of coherently discussing the topic, hence demonstrating a sound
knowledge of computing within the chosen area and an ability to explain academic concepts to a
degree that shows a full understanding. The knowledge and concepts should go beyond those called for
in the current Computer science guide.

-

# Criterion E: reasoned argument
Students should be aware of the need to give their essays the backbone of a developing argument.
Personal views should not simply be stated but need to be supported by reasoned argument or
experimentation to persuade the reader of their validity. Straightforward descriptive or narrative
accounts that lack analysis do not usually advance an argument and should be avoided.

-

# Criterion F: application of analytical and evaluative skills appropriate to the
subject
A computer science extended essay demands that the student applies logical, critical and creative
thinking to a specific topic, as well as showing an appreciation of the consequences arising from
technological development.

-

#  Criterion G: use of language appropriate to the subject
The effective use of computer science terminology includes the appropriate use of technical
vocabulary. Layman terms for computer parts and systems should not be used.

-

# Criterion H: conclusion
“Consistent” is the key word here: the conclusion should develop out of the argument and not introduce
new or extraneous matter. It should not repeat the material of the introduction; rather, it should present
a new synthesis in light of the discussion. It should be evident from the conclusion that the student has
fully understood the implications of the topic and is able to make a clear, independent evaluation.

-

# Criterion I: formal presentation
This criterion relates to the extent to which the essay conforms to academic standards about the way in
which research papers should be presented. The presentation of essays that omit a bibliography or that
do not give references for quotations is deemed unacceptable (level 0). Essays that omit one of the
required elements—title page, table of contents, page numbers—are deemed no better than satisfactory
(maximum level 2), while essays that omit two of them are deemed poor at best (maximum level 1).
Program code should generally be placed in an appendix. Where it needs to be included within the
body of the essay, each line of code should count as two words when calculating the length of the
essay, while any internal documentation of a program fragment should be ignored.

-

# Criterion J: abstract
The abstract is judged on the clarity with which it presents an overview of the research and the essay,
not on the quality of the research question itself, nor on the quality of the argument or the conclusions.

-

# Criterion K: holistic judgment
Qualities that are rewarded under this criterion include the following.
• Intellectual initiative: Ways of demonstrating this in computer science essays include using
sources other than the internet and printed resources to gain information that could not have
been found otherwise.
• Insight and depth of understanding: These are most likely to be demonstrated as a
consequence of detailed research, reflection that is thorough and well-informed, and reasoned
argument that consistently and effectively addresses the research question.
• Creativity: This can be shown in many ways, for example, by using an unusual but effective
approach, by taking a controversial, but credible, stance or by extrapolating an extra logical
step when forming a conclusion.
